# Hangman Game - Rules

## Objective
The goal of the game is to guess the secret word correctly before running out of chances.

## How to Play
- The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list of fruit names.
- The player has to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.
- The word is displayed as underscores `_` for unguessed letters.
- If a guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in its correct position(s) in the word.
- If a guessed letter is incorrect, the number of chances left decreases.
- The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of chances.

## Game Rules
1. The player can only enter **a single letter** per guess.
2. The guessed letter **must be an alphabet**; non-letter inputs are invalid.
3. If the guessed letter has already been used, the player must try a different letter.
4. If all letters in the word are guessed correctly, the player wins.
5. If the player runs out of chances, they lose, and the correct word is revealed.

## Winning Strategy
- Start with commonly used vowels (A, E, I, O, U) to uncover parts of the word.
- Avoid repeating letters already guessed.
- Try to identify common fruit names based on revealed letters.

## Game End
- The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or loses all chances.
- If the player quits, the game stops immediately.
